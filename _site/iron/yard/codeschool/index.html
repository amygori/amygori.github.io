      <p>I like to do things the hard way. Apparently. I supposed you could call it choosing challenge over boredom, or something like that. Given the choice between two options of things to do, I have almost invariably chosen the harder one. This has its advantages and disadvantages as a life strategy, obviously.  </p>

<p>Sure, there have been times when I’ve regretted my stubborn refusal to do things the easy way.  </p>

<p>Going to code school has not been one of those times.  </p>

<p>Last spring I read a Wall Street Journal article about code development bootcamp. I enrolled in <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/" title="The Iron Yard">The Iron Yard Academy</a> in Durham, NC.<br />
<br />
Three months of intensive training in front end development required a lot to get through. The 80+ hours work- weeks were not an exaggeration. The workload was nearly crushing, the pace relentless. I swore I could actually <em>feel</em> new synaptic pathways being created in my brain each and every day.<br />
<br />
But climbing that mountain was, in the end, incredibly satisfying. I can’t believe what I know now. I mean, my education as a front-end developer has just begun, of course, but I feel like I’ve earned my passport to this new country. I speak the language. I can pick up the tools and, even if I don’t know quite how to use them, I know what they’re used for and – this is the crucial part – I know how to figure out how to use them.<br />
<br />
At some point midway through, I had a moment of clarity amid the struggle. My greatest obstacle to progress was my own frustration.<br />
<br />
Ok. It is nearly impossible to be patient with yourself when you have to turn in homework every day at six am, and your first assignment is “Reproduce this PDF of a webpage in pixel perfection…in code. Which you just learned in the past three hours.”<br />
<br />
I learned to just keep pushing through the lack of understanding, to reframe that lack of understanding as a question that might get me back on track, rather than stack it up as mounting evidence of my failure.<br />
<br />
And I learned the importance of putting a problem aside and taking a break – a short walk in the fresh air sometimes, or sometimes a night’s sleep.<br />
<br />
I am amazed at how many mornings I woke up with a new solution to a problem I couldn’t solve the night before.  Sometimes that solution even worked the first time!<br />
<br />
There is a sweet spot of clarity I’m discovering more and more here on the other side of code school, now that I am liberated from some of those pressures.  I’ve been continuing to study and work with Javascript, and the more I do, the more a-ha moments I have. It’s making me realize that there is something zen-like in the practice of writing code.  There is a calm, serene place where I am in sync with its logic, where I can visualize the next step even before I have figured out how to write it.<br />
<br />
And once again I am reminded of how much this whole experience has made me feel like I am living The Matrix.<br />
<br />
I know Kung Fu. </p>

I like to do things the hard way. Apparently. I supposed you could call it choosing challenge over boredom, or something like that. Given the choice between two options of things to do, I have almost invariably chosen the harder one. This has its advantages and disadvantages as a life strategy, obviously.  

Sure, there have been times when I’ve regretted my stubborn refusal to do things the easy way.  

Going to code school has not been one of those times.  

Last spring I read a Wall Street Journal article about code development bootcamp. I enrolled in [The Iron Yard Academy] [1] in Durham, NC.  
<br/>
Three months of intensive training in front end development required a lot to get through. The 80+ hours work- weeks were not an exaggeration. The workload was nearly crushing, the pace relentless. I swore I could actually *feel* new synaptic pathways being created in my brain each and every day.  
<br/>
But climbing that mountain was, in the end, incredibly satisfying. I can’t believe what I know now. I mean, my education as a front-end developer has just begun, of course, but I feel like I've earned my passport to this new country. I speak the language. I can pick up the tools and, even if I don’t know quite how to use them, I know what they’re used for and -- this is the crucial part -- I know how to figure out how to use them.  
<br/>
At some point midway through, I had a moment of clarity amid the struggle. My greatest obstacle to progress was my own frustration.  
<br/>
Ok. It is nearly impossible to be patient with yourself when you have to turn in homework every day at six am, and your first assignment is “Reproduce this PDF of a webpage in pixel perfection...in code. Which you just learned in the past three hours.”  
<br/>
I learned to just keep pushing through the lack of understanding, to reframe that lack of understanding as a question that might get me back on track, rather than stack it up as mounting evidence of my failure.  
<br/>
And I learned the importance of putting a problem aside and taking a break -- a short walk in the fresh air sometimes, or sometimes a night’s sleep.  
<br/>
I am amazed at how many mornings I woke up with a new solution to a problem I couldn’t solve the night before.  Sometimes that solution even worked the first time!  
<br/>
There is a sweet spot of clarity I’m discovering more and more here on the other side of code school, now that I am liberated from some of those pressures.  I’ve been continuing to study and work with Javascript, and the more I do, the more a-ha moments I have. It’s making me realize that there is something zen-like in the practice of writing code.  There is a calm, serene place where I am in sync with its logic, where I can visualize the next step even before I have figured out how to write it.  
<br/>
And once again I am reminded of how much this whole experience has made me feel like I am living The Matrix.  
<br/>
I know Kung Fu.
